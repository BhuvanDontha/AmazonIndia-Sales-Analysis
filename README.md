Findings and Reporting – 

•	The Amazon Product Sales dataset is useful for analytics since it contains a significant number of records. All necessary elements, including Actual Price and Number of Ratings, were filled in. As seen during the Data Cleaning stage of this analytics project.
•	the Amazon Product Sales dataset has a large number of missing values in addition to erroneous entries in several areas. This takes a lot of cleaning time and skill.
•	Some of my findings include the following –

1.	TV, audio & cameras
2.	Stores
3.	Appliances

4.	Bigwig MATTE BLUE EYELINER
5.	TIMELINE Wash Basin and Sink Cleaning Multipurpose Brush

•	Additionally, as the correlation data shows, buyers like items with higher ratings in categories and those with high ratings overall; the best-selling products fall into the 4.2 to 4.4 rating range.
•	One significant tendency in product sales has been observed: consumers frequently purchase top-selling goods from the same brand.
•	Key elements influencing product sales include:
	Most sales appear to be in well-established product categories including clothing, appliances, and electronics.
	It doesn't appear that discounts boost sales. In fact, it was shown that items with significant discounts have lower sales (the correlation coefficient data demonstrates this).
	The item's pricing (original price) has no bearing on the number of sales.
